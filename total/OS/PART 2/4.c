/*
Program that creates two processes, a parent and a child where the child is
created via the fork() system call. The parent reads the content of a le and
sends them to child via Interprocess communication (IPC).The child receives the
data send by the parent and write them to another le. Hints: You can use any one
of the IPC mechanism like UNIX/LINUX pipes, Shared memory or message queue .
